## Introduction

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides a way to structure content on the web and is the foundation of all websites. In this lesson, we will go over the basics of HTML and learn how to create a simple web page.

#### Understanding HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages and are used to define the structure and content of a web page. An HTML element is defined by a start tag and an end tag, with content in between. For example, the following code defines a heading element:

      <h1>This is a heading</h1>

#### Creating a Simple Web Page

To create a web page, you need to start with a text editor and save the file with the ".html" extension. Here's an example of a simple HTML web page:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
    </body>
    </html>

#### Understanding the Basic Structure of an HTML Page

The above example shows the basic structure of an HTML page, including the DOCTYPE declaration, the HTML element, the head element, and the body element.
The DOCTYPE declaration defines the type of HTML being used.
The HTML element is the root element and contains all the other elements on the page.
The head element contains information about the document, such as the title, which is displayed in the browser's title bar.
The body element contains the content that will be displayed on the web page.
Adding Content to the Page: You can add various types of content to an HTML page, including text, images, links, and more. For example, you can add an image to your web page using the following code:

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">

#### Conclusion

HTML is the foundation of all websites and provides a way to structure content on the web. With this introduction to HTML, you should now be able to create a simple web page. There is much more to learn about HTML, including styling and layout, but this should give you a good starting point.
