## CSS Layout and Responsive Design

In this lesson, we will explore more advanced CSS topics related to layout and responsive design.

### CSS Layout

CSS provides several methods for controlling the layout of a web page, including:

- Floating elements
- Display properties (such as inline, block, and inline-block)
- Flexbox and Grid layout

### Floating Elements

Floating elements are used to position elements side by side, rather than stacked on top of each other. The float property is used to specify which elements should be floated, and the clear property is used to prevent elements from flowing around floated elements.

In example above, the img element has a class of **float-left** and is given a float property of left. This makes the image float to the left and allows text to wrap around it on the right. The margin-right property adds some space between the text and the image.

You can also float elements to the right by giving the float property a value of right.

### Display Properties

The display property is used to control the display type of an element. For example, the **display: block** value sets an element to generate a block-level box, which creates a rectangular box that spans the full width of its parent container, creating a new block formatting context.

In the above example, the **h1** element with the class **block-element** has a display property of block. This causes the h1 element to generate a block-level box that spans the full width of its parent container (the div with the class container), and creates a new block formatting context. The background color, padding, and text alignment are then styled using other CSS properties.

### Flexbox and Grid Layout

Flexbox and Grid are modern CSS layout systems that provide advanced layout capabilities.

Flexbox is used for arranging elements within a single dimension, such as along a row or a column.

In the above example, the parent container div with the class container has a display property of flex. This causes the container to generate a flex container and the direct children elements within it (the div elements with the class flex-item) to generate flex items. The justify-content and align-items properties are then used to control the alignment of the flex items within the container.

In the above example, the parent container div with the class container has a display property of grid. This causes the container to generate a grid container and the direct children elements within it (the div elements with the class grid-item) to generate grid items. The grid-template-columns property is then used to define the number and width of columns in the grid, and the grid-gap property is used to specify the gap between grid items.

### Responsive Design

Responsive design is a method of designing web pages that adjusts to the size and orientation of the device it is being viewed on. This is achieved by using CSS media queries, which allow you to specify different styles for different screen sizes.

Here's an example of a responsive design that changes the layout of a website when the screen size is less than 800 pixels wide:

```css
/* Default styles */
.container {
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
justify-content: space-between;
}

.box {
width: 30%;
height: 300px;
background-color: lightblue;
margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Media query styles */
@media (max-width: 800px) {
.container {
    flex-direction: column;
}

.box {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
}
}
```
        

![CSS image](/Articles/FrontEnd/CSS/layout5.png "CSS introduction")

In this example, the **.container** class uses **display: flex** to display its children (.box) in a row. The **justify-content: space-between** property aligns the boxes with equal space between them. The **flex-wrap: wrap** property allows the boxes to wrap onto a new row if they don't fit on the current row.

The media query checks the screen size using **max-width: 800px**. If the screen size is less than 800 pixels wide, the styles inside the media query are applied. The **.container** class uses **flex-direction: column** to change the direction of the flexbox to a column, and the **.box** class changes its width to 100% and its height to 200px.

### Practice

Try creating a simple layout using floating elements, display properties, and/or Flexbox or Grid. Then, add media queries to make the layout responsive.

In the next lesson, we will cover HTML and CSS best practices, such as using semantic HTML and writing maintainable CSS code.
