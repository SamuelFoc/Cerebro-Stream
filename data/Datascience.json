    "text": "Data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data. Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, medicine). Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, as a research paradigm, as a research method, as a discipline, as a workflow, and as a profession."
