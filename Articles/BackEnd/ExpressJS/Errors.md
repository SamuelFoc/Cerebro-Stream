## Error handling

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Route for the homepage
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

// Route for handling errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Internal server error");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
});
```

In this code, we're using the app.use() method to define an error handler. This error handler is used to handle any errors that occur in the application.

The error handler takes four parameters: err, req, res, and next. The err parameter is the error object that was thrown by the application. The req parameter is the request object that triggered the error. The res parameter is the response object that will be sent to the client. The next parameter is a function that can be called to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

Inside the error handler, we're logging the error stack trace to the console and sending a 500 status code to the client with a message indicating an internal server error has occurred.

It's important to note that error handling in ExpressJS is done asynchronously, which means that any errors that occur in asynchronous functions or callbacks need to be handled differently. One common approach is to use a package like async-handler to wrap asynchronous functions with try-catch blocks and handle any errors using the error handler.
