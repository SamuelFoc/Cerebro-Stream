## Event Handling and DOM Manipulation with JavaScript

In this lesson, we will cover two important topics in JavaScript: `event handling` and `DOM manipulation`.

### Event Handling

JavaScript allows you to handle events, such as a button click, a form submission, or a page load. You can add event handlers to elements using the addEventListener method, which takes the event type and a callback function as arguments.

### DOM Manipulation

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-like structure that represents the structure of a web page. JavaScript allows you to access and modify the elements in the DOM, making it possible to change the content, style, and layout of a web page dynamically.

### DOM Traversal

In order to manipulate elements in the DOM, you need to be able to locate them. You can use methods such as getElementById, getElementsByTagName, and querySelector to select elements in the DOM.

### DOM Modification

Once you have selected an element in the DOM, you can use properties such as innerHTML, style, and classList to modify its content, style, and class.

### Practice

Try creating a simple web page and adding interactivity using event handling and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

In the next lesson, we will cover how to use JavaScript to make HTTP requests and work with APIs to retrieve and update data.
