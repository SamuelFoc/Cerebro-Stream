## Starting with HTML

As a first step in web development journey is to choose a good editor for your work. The best choice for web developers is `Visual Studio Code` (VS code). It should't be confused with Visual Studio.
Installation of VS code can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). <br>
<br>

#### Let's get started

Create a new folder anywhere you like to, for example right on your desktop, and give it a name `HTML`. Open this folder, click to the path box, type in `cmd` and press enter.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 40px 0;">

In a while command promt should appear on your screen.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 40px 0;">

Type `code .` in to command prompt and press enter.<br>
Now you should see the VS code editor welcome page. Congratulation you handled the first step on your way.

#### Write your very first HTML

Now when we have a good editor is time to write some code. Create a new file called `index.html` and open it. Now you have to install extension we will use all the time during these lessons, it's called `Live Server`. Go to the left panel and click on extensions and find the mentioned extension and click install.

Now if you right click on desktop in your file you should see option `Open with Live Server`. If you will click on the option your HTML code will be opened by your browser.<br>
The very first element you will use everytime when you'll write an HTML document is `html` tag. This tag tells to your browser that this file contains HTML language. Every other HTML you'll write must be inside the HTML tag.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 40px 0;">

In the picture you can see two more tags: `Head` and `Body`. These tags are used for two different thing. `Head` tag contains the information about your page in `meta` tags. Don't worry about these for now, you'll learn everything later. The most important tag that you can use inside the `Head` is `title` tag. This tag gives you the oportunity to change the title that can user see on the browser tab.
