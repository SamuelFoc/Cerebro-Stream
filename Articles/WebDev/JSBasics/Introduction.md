## Introduction to JavaScript

In this lesson, we will introduce JavaScript, a programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

### What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development. It can be used to add interactivity, animations, and dynamic content to web pages, making them more engaging and user-friendly.

### Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store values. Variables are declared using the var or let keywords, and values can be assigned to them using the assignment operator =.

### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types, including:

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Array
- Object

### Operators

JavaScript has several operators, such as:

- Arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, \*, /)
- Comparison operators (e.g., <, >, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||)

### Conditional Statements

In JavaScript, conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. For example, you can use an if statement to check if a condition is true, and execute code inside the if block if it is.

### Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be called repeatedly, making it easier to reuse code and write modular code. Functions can accept parameters and return values.

### Practice

Try writing some simple JavaScript code to practice working with variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and functions.

In the next lesson, we will cover more advanced topics in JavaScript, such as event handling, and how to use JavaScript to manipulate the HTML DOM.
