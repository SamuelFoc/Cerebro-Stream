## Understanding HTML Elements and Attributes

In the previous lesson, we covered the basics of HTML and why it is important for creating websites. Now that you have a basic understanding of HTML, it's time to dive deeper and learn about HTML elements and attributes.

### HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. They define the structure and content of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. Some common HTML elements include:

```html
    <h1> to <h6> for headings
    <p> for paragraphs
    <ul> and <li> for unordered lists
    <ol> and <li> for ordered lists
    <a> for links
    <img> for images
    <div> for sections of content
    <form> for forms
```

### HTML Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are added to an element in the opening tag and are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. Some common HTML attributes include:

```html
- <div class=""> for defining the styles for an element
- <div id=""> for defining a unique identifier for an element
- <img src=""> for defining the source of an image
- <link href=""> for defining the destination of a link
- <img alt=""> for defining alternative text for an image
```

### Practice

To learn more about HTML elements and attributes, try creating a simple web page using the elements and attributes listed above. You can also try modifying the attributes to see how they affect the appearance of the page.

In the next lesson, we will cover the basics of Table elements. For now, focus on understanding HTML elements and attributes and get comfortable using them in your own web pages.
