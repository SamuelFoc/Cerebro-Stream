    "text": "Front-end development refers to the development of the client-side of a web application. It encompasses the design, layout, and interaction of a website or web application as experienced by users. Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build user interfaces and create engaging, interactive user experiences. They are responsible for ensuring that a website looks good, works smoothly, and is accessible to all users, regardless of their device or browser. Front-end development is a crucial aspect of web development and requires a strong understanding of user experience, design principles, and web technologies."
